**The page '/cookie-wall' returns a 404?**
You didn't refresh your permalinks.

**The page '/cookie_wall' fails in Nginx?**
Because it should be '/cookie-wall' since v0.3.0

**I'm getting an Javascript error '$ is not defined'**
When using Nginx you need to have

'if ($request_uri ~ ^/wp-content ) {
     set $ll_cookie_exist '0';
}'

**My server config returns an error**  
Note when pasting the config rules via your editor, it doesn\'t add weird line-breaks.
