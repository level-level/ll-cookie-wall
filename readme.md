# Discontinued

This plugin is **discontinued** due to the EU GDPR (in Dutch AVG) rules. Blocking a website is not the way to enforce privacy laws. The Dutch Authority guarding our privacy, wrote (in Dutch) a paper on why a cookiewall is not allowed anymore. The GDPR states that there should be 'free will' for a visitor to choose if they accept tracking cookies. A cookiewall in effect is a 'take it or leave it' approach.
